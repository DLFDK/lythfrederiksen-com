                Projects, obsessions, a loner's poor substitute for meaningful human connections - no matter what you call'em, I got'em in spades
                <!-- Other people have kids - I have projects.
                I love my projects. Projects are life. 
                I may have labelled them projects, but they are honestly more like obsessions. Rabbit holes, which consume all mental energy for a little while. -->
