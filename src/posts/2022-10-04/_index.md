snippet: "I’m a pixel-pincher. You know, like a penny-pincher but with pixels? Anyway, I hate sending along pixels that don’t end up on the screen. It’s wasteful and I don’t like it! In this blog post I detail how I load perfectly sized images using a tiny bit of javascript and an image CDN. Full code included!"
