Subsetting is the practice of extracting glyphs from a font and creating a reduced set of the original. Doing so can be useful in the pursuit of smaller font files that are quicker to load, thus avoiding delayed text rendering or having to do a switch-over from a system font. These issues are also known as flash-of-invisible-text (FOIT) and flash-of-unstyled-text (FOUT). Check out the [writings by Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/web/fonts/) for a deep dive on font loading.
